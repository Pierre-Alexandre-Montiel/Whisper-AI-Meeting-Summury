OKS2I is the podcast to know everything about tech on S2E Hi everyone, I'm Sylvain and you're listening to OKS2I, the podcast to know everything about tech on S2E New episode for this third season, today we're going to talk about DevOps So what is DevOps, what's it for and what are the benefits? To answer these questions, I have with me in the studio Aifa Zran, who is the leader of DevOps transformation at S2E Hello Aifa Hello Sylvain Thank you for being with us to answer all these questions and find out what DevOps is Are you ready? Yes So let's start right away with OKS2I, what is DevOps? As usual in the podcast, Aifa, before going into the details and the hard part of the subject, to know what are the benefits of DevOps and what is it for, can you give us a little definition of DevOps? DevOps is an approach, a step that includes the culture of working together, sharing knowledge, automating and using tools that will allow us to deliver continuous, low-perimeter, more secure and high-quality services to our customers. We can also see DevOps as the agility brought to the operational team DevOps is a bit of a philosophy It's a philosophy, that's it I read while preparing the episode, what is the name of DevOps? It's Dev and Ops Quite simply It's simply bringing the two worlds together that didn't speak to each other in the past And thanks to that, it will speak to each other Yes And that's what we're going to see right now in the second part of the episode Aifa, we saw what DevOps was in the first part, tell me how and why we put DevOps in a company? So, how it will depend on several factors, in particular the degree of maturity of each company and teams on DevOps So it's different each time? It's a very broad subject, it's different from one company to another depending on its culture too So how we saw it, you told me it was too complicated to explain like that since there are different degrees of maturity for companies So why do we put DevOps in place, Aifa? We have several gains and benefits that have been observed over the years in companies Yes Concerning DevOps, in particular, making the infrastructure more robust, more resilient It will be able to repair itself with the automation offered by DevOps So we will be able to take advantage of the high availability offered by the cloud Yes And in this way we will secure the infrastructure, make it more available, more secure for deployment and more robust in case of major incidents Yes, so it's a huge case for a company when we put it in place Yes How long does it take to put DevOps in place in a company? It depends on the starting point, generally it's between 2 years to 5 years After 5 years, we will go from a phenomenon called fatigue of change So here we will start to transform but we will not see the gains So people will be disinterested in this movement We will return to the starting point which is a team that is not working together with manual tasks that are not automated We lose all the benefits of this approach Thanks to the automation and cooperation between teams, deployments will be faster, easier, with fewer perimeters We will have a human interaction between the different teams and also less mistakes because everything is automated in the tools Ok So that's really the first gain that we can see when we put this approach in place As we will automate deployments too, we will be able to deliver faster and more frequently to the demand of the job So that's also today, we are in the world of speed, speed, instantaneity The client, as soon as he has an idea, he wants to put it into production directly With DevOps and the cloud, it's possible today So I understand well, it's speed and quality That's it, speed, quality, value, we talk about client value when we say quality So if we go back to the quality part too, we improve the quality thanks to the automation of the tests Which are mostly manual Today we also recommend testing as soon as possible, it's called the shift left It's testing earlier and even writing the tests before starting development So that's very important, this notion of having instant feedback, failing earlier In the DevOps culture, we also tolerate failure, that's important And that's something we're trying to put in place in the corporate culture when we start a transformation So there's a lot of work in the pipeline Yes That's almost all DevOps Yes, the work is more the human part that is harder The technical part is easy to put in place The cloud too, we can put it in place, it's more this human part Get everyone to work together DevOps, job, architect, test Everyone who is supposed to work on a product lifecycle That's the hardest part in DevOps One last advantage I think, Ifeha One last advantage, and it's the most important advantage and that speaks the most to the job, to the management It's the reduction of time to value Which means time reduction, money saving And also we will be able to enrich our product in an iterative way With new features And thus bring more innovation to the company What's the time to value in this? There's the time to market part, which means accelerating deliveries Time to market is the time between the idea, having an idea, and putting it in place Okay, that's what you were saying earlier, the speed that makes it go So it's the speed via automation, the value via quality and security So when we say security, we will minimize the production impact We will also make gains on cost of constraints, on production So these are gains that have been noted, it's the most important gain for companies As the DevOps transformation approach concerns a lot of culture, human aspect The approach also between people, when we said we will also reduce the impact rate on the products The operators and people who intervene on the incidents all the time They will have more availability to collaborate with the rest of the team Especially with the developers to improve the quality of this delivery And thus have better conditions in the team to work So that's an aspect that is very important too We don't work when we are stressed, we are zen, we are relaxed We work as a team and in collaboration So DevOps is nice Yes And you Aifa, to come back to you, leader in DevOps transformation, in two words, what does it consist of? So I support the managers and the teams in this transformation I am on the management aspect, I also set up audits on DevOps maturity I set up action plans, roadmaps, roadmap, transformation, either technical or managerial Because the manager also has to have a different posture Not a commando manager but a leader manager So all this is supported via information, via coaching too And the implementation of tools Tell me Aifa, DevOps is the current trend But we know very well that in our digital world everything is going very fast And that there are always new things coming up What is your future in DevOps? So today, DevOps is more about the IT part of the company So when in the company we will start to see the gains and benefits of DevOps On costs, on deadlines, on the best working conditions This phenomenon and this approach will start to spread everywhere In the company, in other sectors too But that is to say? Improving the work processes in the human resources team too Because everything is related to IT In the other sectors Yes, we will not necessarily talk only about infrastructure Now we will go in all sectors, in all business services Knowing that DevOps is based a lot on Lean Management And Lean Management, the idea behind it Lean Management was born in the industrial environment In Japan, in the industrial environment, in Toyota I think Sylvain was talking about the future of DevOps And it will take a lot of time There is a lot more to say You know what? I propose that we do a new episode Only dedicated to the future of DevOps We will do that Are you OK?
